**Benchmark Baseline Results* 

In this benchmark folder, we provide proofs of the benchmark baseline that we've run on state-of-art smart contract vulnerability tools. The folder contains the 
output after we run the tools. In the first table below, we record the vulnerability detection results based on Mythril.
