**[Saddle Finance Attack](https://medium.com/immunefi/hack-analysis-saddle-finance-april-2022-f2bcb119f38)**

Saddle Finance has two pools - standard and meta pools. . A Standard pool is a pool that acts as a normal AMM pool where tokens provided as liquidity are those that can also be swapped via the pool.
A meta pool consists of a pegged token and a token that represents liquidity in a standard pool. Essentially, Meta pools allow liquidity in one pool to be used in additional pools. For instance, a depositor can deposit $1000 of DAI in Curveâ€™s 3-pool and then deposit this as liquidity in the MIM-3 pool, allowing them to earn yield from trades in both the 3-pool and MIM pools respectively, while also providing deeper liquidity within both pools

The root cause lies in the library contract `MetaSwapUtils` due to the inconsistency of price calculations:

In the _calculateSwap() function, we have: 

```
dy = xp[tokenIndexTo].sub(y).sub(1);
dyFee = dy.mul(self.swapFee).div(FEE_DENOMINATOR);
dy = dy.sub(dyFee).div(self.tokenPrecisionMultipliers[tokenIndexTo]);
```
But in _calculateWithdrawOneTokenDY() function, we have: 

```
   uint256 dy =
            xpReduced[tokenIndex].sub(
                SwapUtils.getYD(v.preciseA, tokenIndex, xpReduced, v.d1)
            );

        if (tokenIndex == xp.length.sub(1)) {
            dy = dy.mul(BASE_VIRTUAL_PRICE_PRECISION).div(baseVirtualPrice);
        }
        dy = dy.sub(1).div(self.tokenPrecisionMultipliers[tokenIndex]);
 ```
