**[ElasticSwap Attack](https://quillaudits.medium.com/decoding-elastic-swaps-850k-exploit-quillaudits-9ceb7fcd8d1a)**

The root cause is the two different token accounting mechanisms used in `addLiquidity` and `removeLiquidity` functions. For `addLiquidity`,
it uses internal k algorithm; for `removeLiquidity`, it uses the exchange between baseToken and quoteToken in the current pool;

The attackers take four steps: 
1. The attacker begins by adding liquidity to the TIC-USDC pool.
2. then deposits $USDC.e directly into the TIC-USDC pool.
3. The attacker then removed the liquidity, causing the contractâ€™s internal USDC reserve to become unbalanced
4. Finally, when the pool became unbalanced, the attacker swapped USDC for TIC tokens and made a profit out of it
