Below is the official annnouncement from n00dle:  the fix is to employ new tokens

- Deploy new ERC20 tokens (these new tokens cannot interact with previous contracts, hence providing extra safety)
- Snapshot the current 3gg and n00d holders
- Create a merkle claim contract to allow holders claim the new tokens
- Resume liquidity on new tokens

Please make any suggestions in #ðŸ’¬ãƒ»lounge regarding the solution.

@everyone within the next few hours, we will create new tokens and airdrop to existing token (n00d and 3gg) holders. Holders would not need to do anything. 

Rationale behind why we need to deploy a new token
- The exploited contracts will haunt us forever had we not deployed a new token

Rationale behind why we are not deploying a token swap contract but snapshotting the current token holders
- We have no control over when the token swap will end had we deployed a token swap contract. It might drag on forever. Airdropping is the quickest way to help us resume liquidity
- Snapshotting and airdropping is a more gas and engineering efficient method considering the amount of holders

We will conduct the snapshot at 4:00pm ET. Please refrain from transferring the tokens after 3:30pm ET.
We will immediately notify etherscan and coingecko after the airdrop
